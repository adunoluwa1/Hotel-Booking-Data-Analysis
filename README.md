# Hotel-Bookings-Descriptive-Analysis
--------------------------------------
This project showcases my knowledge of:
    - current data management and data mining best practices and tools, 
    - BI reporting, and 
    - data engineering, preparation and transformation platforms

- The table folder stores the .csv files which contain data extracts from a hotel system (bookings, food orders, menu, requests and rooms).
- Data cleaning, transformation and manipulation was done using the SQL queries in the HB Query folder.
- The data was further cleaned and visualized using Power BI and the local files are in the Dashboards folder
