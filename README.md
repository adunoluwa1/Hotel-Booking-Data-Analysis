# Hotel-Bookings-Descriptive-Analysis
--------------------------------------
This project showcases my knowledge of:
• current data management and data mining best practices and tools, 
• BI reporting, and 
• data engineering, preparation and transformation platforms
The table folder stores the .csv files which contain data extracts from a hotel system (bookings, food orders, menu, requests and rooms).
Data cleaning, transformation and manipulation was done using the SQL queries in the HB Query folder.
The data was further cleaned and visualized using Power BI and the local files are in the Dashboards folder
